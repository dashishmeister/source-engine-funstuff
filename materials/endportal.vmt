//you can use lightmapped reflective with a normal texture, this will disable any sort of texture projection
//(i.e. it will stay flat and not move no matter how you look at it)
//try disabling clamp s and clamp t to have your texture tile
//replace "MyCoolTexture" with whatever you want

"LightmappedReflective"
{
	"%tooltexture" "MyCoolTexture" //used for hammer preview
	"$reflecttexture" "MyCoolTexture"
	"$surfaceprop" "default_silent"
	"$nodecal" "1"
}

//todo: check if you need func_reflective glass
